## Core Concept

Upon launching the game, users register with a unique username. Bubbles rise from the bottom of the screen at varying speeds, sizes, and colors. Players must click the bubbles to pop them, earning points for each successful hit. The game tracks each user’s high score, encouraging competitiveness and replayability.
